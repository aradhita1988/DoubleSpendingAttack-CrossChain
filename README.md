# Double-spending-CrossChain
To organize and execute the three different double-spending attack scenarios (Traditional Double Spending, Double Spending with an Observer, and Eclipse-based Double Spending) in a cross-chain environment, you can set up the project in a structured way with separate folders for each scenario. Here's a step-by-step guide for organizing the code into three different folders and running each attack scenario: 


# Softwares required:
    - Install *Node.js*
    - Install *Ganache*
    - Install *Truffle *

1. Compile your Solidity contract:
    truffle compile
2. Migrate the contract to Ganache:
   truffle migrate --network development   
3. Interact with the Contract via Web3 
   npm install web3 @truffle/hdwallet-provider
4.  Run the script to interact with the smart contract:
    node depoly.js   
5.Install the required dependencies (crypto-js, elliptic):
  npm install crypto-js elliptic  
6. Simulate the Double-Spending Attack 
   intearct.js
